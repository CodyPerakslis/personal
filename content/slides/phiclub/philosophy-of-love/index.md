## Philosophy of *Love*

What is Love?  
Why is Love?

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Taken from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/love/
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

## Step 1: Defining Love

[Elenchus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-01-classics-of-western-philosophy-spring-2016/lecture-notes/MIT24_01S16_SES3.pdf)

[Ordinary Language Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_language_philosophy)

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Following a track of definition based, at least initially, in how love is used
- Elenchus, the socratic method, attemps to find a "What is" definition
- OLP, or Oxford Philosophy, goes farther to state that we *know* what love is already, and any attempts should be to understand these definitions, not redefine them
- What do you think love is?
{{< /speaker_note >}}

## Big Brains in Definitions

{{< youtube ZOuLLAPhyvw >}}

{{< speaker_note >}}
- The very much disagree on definitions
- Socrates wants essential definition
- Wittgenstein against generalization, abstraction
- Don't think, just look

{{< speaker_note >}}
- These require a more deliberate understanding of love
- Greek terms

### Eros

- Passionate desire
- [Acquisitive love](https://www.amazon.com/Agape-Eros-Anders-Nygren/dp/B0007DM5V2) - selfish
- [Erosic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Soble): dependent on reasons

{{% fragment %}}<img src="https://www.greekboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Eros-720x538.jpg" width="500">{{% /fragment %}}

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Desire often sexual
- Eros (Cupid) has been primordial, birth of humanity, and mischievous
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

### Agape
- Brotherly love
- Spontaneous and unmotivated
- Creates value in the loved

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Love between us and God
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

### Philia
- Affectionate regard
- Response to qualities in the loved

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Love between us and God
- Typically blurred with Eros, which is philia + sexual desire
{{< /speaker_note >}}

## Loving vs Liking
What is the difference?

{{% fragment %}}"Depth"{{% /fragment %}}  
{{% fragment %}}Identity{{% /fragment %}}
> {{% fragment %}}The choice between one potential love and another can feel, and be, like a choice of a way of life, a decision to dedicate oneself to these values rather than these ~ Nussbaum{{% /fragment %}}
{{< speaker_note >}}
- Intuitively, love is deeper than like
- What is depth? Identity is agreed upon
- What are some issues with this view? Self-centered?
{{< /speaker_note >}}

## Some Theories of Love
* Love as Union
* Love as Robust Concern
* Love as Valuing
* Love as Emotion

---
## Love as Union
- The lovers become a "we," a *community*
- Redefine their identities as a relationship
- Desire to form a reciprocated "we"
- Federation

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Community as in shared interests become indistinct. Not mine, not
 yours, just ours
- Desire is Nozick, pooling their wellbeing and autonomy
- Federation, the "we" is a distinct entity of its parts
## Issues
- Loss of autonomy
- Egoistic
- New entity
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
## Love as Robust Concern
- Love is volitional
- Concern for the other
- Concern for the relationship with the other

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Volitional (of will) instead of affective or cognitive
## Issues
- Too passive
- Death
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
## Love as Valuing
1. Appraisal  
2. Bestowal



---
### Valuing: Appraisal
- Love *is* appraisal
- *Kant*: Respect arrests our self-love
- *Velleman*: Love arrests our emotional self-defense

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Kant says it is a response to innate human dignity
- Why love so few people? Because how people express their dignity makes them the right fit, or "lovable", by you
- Velleman account is explanatory, not justificatory
- Constancy issue
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
### Valuing: Bestowal
- Project intrinsic value
- Attitude, without objective
- Some valuation, not "blind submission"

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Peter Singer
- Robust concern effect of valuation
- Giving value means responding to them as valuable, which means appraisal
- Contigent on valuation, but also not contigent on valuation (not justificatory)
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
### Both: Deep Improvisation
- Finding each other together
- Recognize and Respond to each others value

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Determining shared values and identity as jazz musicians
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
## Love as Emotion
1. Emotion Proper
2. Emotion Complex

---
### Emotion Proper
- Phenomenological component
- Occurrent mental states as a response to valuations
- Love is positive "feeling towards"

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Phenomenological, fancy word for something you can feel
- Too thin account
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
### Emotion Complex
- "Narrative History"
- Complex tying-together of emotion
- Overall emotional orientation
- *Dynamic Permeability*: Loves changes you
- Person-focused emotion


{{< speaker_note >}}
- Emotional interdependance
- Permeability can lead to the dissolution of love: risky
## Issues
- What ties these emotions together into "love"
- What characteristics of history
- Focus is what the emotion is for: makes the valuation intelligable
- Example: Fear hailstorm because it will hurt my vegetable garden
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
## Why do we Love?

- Promotes self-knowledge
- Well-being
- No reason

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Self-knowledge as a mirror
- "Epistemic significance" to make you a better person
- Well-being, want to be better to be "worthy" of the love
- Love is irrational, can't be justified
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
## Main Concerns of Love
1. What, if anything, justifies my loving rather than not loving this particular person?
2. What, if anything, justifies my coming to love this particular person rather than someone else?
3. What, if anything, justifies my continuing to love this particular person given the changes—both in him and me and in the overall circumstances—that have occurred since I began loving him?

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Fungibility
- phenomenologically non-fungible
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---
## Walking Back: Personal
- Love is an expansion of the self into the infinite
- Like a happy horcrux
- Love as the egoistic bestowal of value

{{< speaker_note >}}
- In Symposium, this was time, mortality
- For me, this is through space as well. We do it not to live on, but to *be* more, experience more
{{< /speaker_note >}}
